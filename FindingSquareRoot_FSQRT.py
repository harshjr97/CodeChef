# Assume that you happen to hear the above words and you want to give a try in finding the square root of any given integer using in-built functions. So here's your chance.

# Input
# The first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T lines follow. Each line contains an integer N whose square root needs to be computed.

# Output
# For each line of the input, output the square root of the input integer, rounded down to the nearest integer, in a new line.

# Constraints
# 1<=T<=20
# 1<=N<=10000
# Input:
# 3
# 10
# 5
# 10000

# Output:
# 3
# 2
# 100


for i in range(int(input())):
    num = int(input())
    sqt = round(num ** 0.5)
    print(sqt)
